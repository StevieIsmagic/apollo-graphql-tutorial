/* REACT HOOKS

Two basic hooks:

State - useState() - allows a way to preserve some values between function calls. useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables disappear when a function exits, but State variables are preserved by React. State variables can hold objects and arrays just fine, so you can still group related data together. However, unlike this.setState in a class, updating a state variable always replaces it instead of merging it.

Effect - useEffect()- lets us perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects. You can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined! Unlike componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate, effects scheduled with useEffect donâ€™t block the browser from updating the screen. This makes your app feel more responsive. 

There are (2) common kinds of side effects in React components:
1 - Effects that don't require cleanup - sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples. We say this because we can run them and immediately forget about them. 

2 - Effects that do require cleanup

NOTE -
We can use multiple State + Effect Hooks in a single component

So how does React know which state corresponds to which useState call? 

The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. 

As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them.

THIS IS WHY HOOKS MUST BE CALLED ON THE TOP LEVEL OF OUR COMPONENTS
